##### Spark deploy instructions #####

Your Spark applications will run in the cluster, but the 'driver' application will run on your machine.
I recommend 2GB RAM and 1 or 2 CPU cores for your driver VM.

A Spark/HDFS cluster has been deployed for you to use. First we'll configure ports and security.
You can use a new or existing VM.

# 0. The web GUIs for Spark and HDFS are not open publicly, so we'll need to configure some port forwarding so that you
can access them via the TCP ports.

To do this, create or modify the file ~/.ssh/config on your local (laptop) computer by adding a section like the one shown below:
(This is unix-like systems and (Windows Subsystem for Linux) WSL, you may have to modify the instructions if you are using some other system).

Replace 130.238.x.y and ~/.ssh/id_rsa with your floating IP and key path appropriately:

Host 130.238.x.y
  User ubuntu
  # modify this to match the name of your key
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  # Spark master web GUI
  LocalForward 8080 192.168.2.113:8080
  # HDFS namenode web gui
  LocalForward 9870 192.168.2.113:9870
  # python notebook
  LocalForward 8888 localhost:8888
  # spark applications
  LocalForward 4040 localhost:4040
  LocalForward 4041 localhost:4041
  LocalForward 4042 localhost:4042
  LocalForward 4043 localhost:4043
  LocalForward 4044 localhost:4044
  LocalForward 4045 localhost:4045
  LocalForward 4046 localhost:4046
  LocalForward 4047 localhost:4047
  LocalForward 4048 localhost:4048
  LocalForward 4049 localhost:4049

Notes:
- The 'IdentityFile' line follows the same syntax whether you are using a .pem key file, or an OpenSSH key file (without an extension), as shown above. For a .pem, write something like this:
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_key.pem
- If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), the path to the identity file needs to be relative to the root of the filesystem for Ubuntu.
- You may get a warning about an "UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!" - to fix this, change the permissions on your key file to 600.
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/mykey.pem
- If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you may need to copy your SSH key into the Ubuntu filesystem to be able to modify the permissions.


With these settings, you can connect to your host like this (without any additional parameters):

ssh 130.238.x.y

And when you access localhost:8080 in your browser, it will be forwarded to 192.168.2.113:8080 - the Web GUI of the Spark master.

0. Check the Spark and HDFS cluster is operating by opening these links in your browser
        http://localhost:8080
        http://localhost:9870

For HDFS, try Utilities > Browse to see the files on the cluster.

0. Assign the security group 'spark-clients' to your virtual machine for it to work correctly with Spark.
    (The machines in the Spark cluster need to be able to connect to your VM)

### These instructions are for Ubuntu 20.04


# update apt repo metadata
sudo apt update

# install java
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk

# manually define a hostname for all the hosts on our project, this will make networking easier with spark:
# NOTE! if you have added entries to /etc/hosts yourself, you need to remove those.
for i in {1..255}; do echo "192.168.1.$i host-192-168-1-$i-ldsa" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts; done
for i in {1..255}; do echo "192.168.2.$i host-192-168-2-$i-ldsa" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts; done

# set the hostname according to the scheme above:
sudo hostname host-$(hostname -I | awk '{$1=$1};1' | sed 's/\./-/'g)-ldsa ; hostname

##### Install the Python Notebook #####

# Env variable so the workers know which Python to use...
echo "export PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# install git
sudo apt-get install -y git

# install python dependencies, start notebook

# install the python package manager 'pip' -- it is recommended to do this directly 
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# check the version -- this is a very old version of pip:
#python3 -m pip --version

# install pyspark (the matching version as the cluster), and some other useful deps
python3 -m pip install pyspark==3.0.1 --user
python3 -m pip install pandas --user
python3 -m pip install matplotlib --user

# clone the examples from the lectures, so we have a copy to experiment with
git clone https://github.com/benblamey/jupyters-public.git

# install jupyterlab
python3 -m pip install jupyterlab

# start the notebook!
python3 -m jupyterlab

# ...follow the instructions you see -- copy the 'localhost' link into your browser.

# Now you can run the examples from the lectures in your own notebook.
# Using the Jupyter Notebook, navigate into the directory you just cloned from GitHub.
# Start with de-2021/Lecture1_Example1_ArraySquareandSum.ipynb
# Ensure the host is set correctly for the Spark master, and namenode, to:
#  192.168.2.113

# When you start your application, you'll see it running in the Spark master web GUI (link at the top).
# If you hover over the link to your application, you'll see the port number for the Web GUI for your application.
# It will be 4040,4041,...
# You can open the GUI in your web browser like this (e.g.):
#   http://localhost:4040

##### Creating your own notebook that deploys spark jobs to the cluster #####

# When working on your own notebooks, save them in your own git repository (which you created in A1, do a git clone) and
# make sure to commit and push changes often (for backup purposes).

# You need to share the Spark cluster with the other students:

# 1. Start your application with dynamic allocation enabled, a timeout of no more than 30 seconds, and a cap on CPU cores:
spark_session = SparkSession\
        .builder\
        .master("spark://192.168.2.113:7077") \
        .appName("blameyben_lecture1_simple_example")\
        .config("spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled", True)\
        .config("spark.shuffle.service.enabled", True)\
        .config("spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout","30s")\
        .config("spark.executor.cores",2)\
        .config("spark.driver.port",9998)\
        .config("spark.blockManager.port",10005)\
        .getOrCreate()

# 2. Put your name in the name of your application.
# 3. Kill your application when your have finished with it.
# 4. Don't interfere with any of the virtual machines in the cluster.
# 5. Run one app at a time.
# 6. When the lab is not running, you can use more resources, but keep an eye on other people using the system.
